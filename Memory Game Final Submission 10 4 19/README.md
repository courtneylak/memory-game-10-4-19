# Memory Game Project

The purpose of this web-based app is to allow the user to be able to play a game of memory of which
two cards (out of a total deck of 16) are chosen by the user and then flipped to see if they match;
with the least amount of flips or guesses in total.

## Installing

Simply put these four files in the same folder on computer or server:

* index2.html
* app.css
* app11.js
* geometry2.img

Open up the index2 from web-browser of choice.

## Instructions

Simply click on any of the randomly shuffled 16 icon cards to begin the timer and begin the game. Click on another card to see if it matches with the first one--if so, user gets 'one' match score point in the score panel above. The objective is to make as many matches as possible in the least amount of time in order to retain a high 3-star rating (too much time over-thinking or methodic memorizing will diminish the star-rating performance matrix.)

Once the 8 matches are completed by the user, a pop-up window will report the user's performance matrix and
prompt either to start a new game or exit altogether.

To restart or refresh the game at any time, simply hit the 'restart' icon at the top.
